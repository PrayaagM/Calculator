For my Grade 11 Introduction to Computer Science course, I decided to create a fully functioning calculator using Python's Tkinter GUI library. Download the .exe file to try it out!

More than functionality, with this project I cared about code reusability. In other words, the code for this calculator is very simple! To add more buttons, you simply add more strings in a list (indicating the label for the button) and then add another string indicating what clicking it should result in on the screen.

I can possibly take advantage of my code's excellant reusability and make it a feature of the software! That is, provide users with the ability to choose which buttons they would like appear in the app, what label each button should have, each button's placement, etc. Creating a customizable calculator is a very interesting idea.
